Do these things.

* Add adverb subdirectories to arrange different conceps with similar names.
* Implement `Is/Algebraically/Group.v` and `Is/Algebraically/Associative.v`.
* Name identifiable things to unitary things, as is convention with categories.
* Generalize associativity etc beyond sensible limits.
* Organize modules coherently.
* Set up a build system (perhaps Dune).
* Integrate Thrift into the mess.
* Monoidal categories now.
