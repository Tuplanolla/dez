# Maniunfold

This is a repository for a research project that aims to

* develop a type-theoretical model of discrete exterior calculus
  (see the related publications),
* formalize the model with the Coq proof assistant
  (see the `bird` subcomponent),
* extract OCaml code from the proof-relevant parts of the formalization
  (see the `ungulate` subcomponent),
* link the extracted code with existing numerical solvers
  (see the `fungus` submodule),
* implement a user interface for the resulting system
  (see the `reptile` subcomponent) and
* define a protocol for distributing and extending it further
  (see the `plant` subcomponent and the associated
  `feathers`, `leaves`, `fur`, `scales`, `spores` and `hair` subcomponents).

The code in this repository is free software and, as such, licensed under

* the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

The development of this project

* started 2018-05-01,
* continues as of 2020-01-27 and
* is expected to reach a usable state by 2022-05-01.

Currently, the sole author of this project is

* Sampsa Kiiskinen, who works
  in the Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä.

This project is partially funded by

* the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (grant 170015).

As one would expect,
the name of this project is a distasteful play on words,
relating the concepts of

* differentiable manifolds,
  the main objects of study in differential geometry, and
* anamorphisms,
  the generalizations of common recursion schemes from functional programming.

Stay tuned for other equally useful facts about this project.
