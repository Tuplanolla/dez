# Discrete Exterior Zoo

This is a repository for a research project that aims to

* develop a type-theoretical model of discrete exterior calculus
  (see the related publications),
* formalize the model with the Coq proof assistant
  (see the `fowl` component),
* extract OCaml code from the proof-relevant parts of the formalization
  (see the `camel` component),
* link the extracted code with an existing numerical solver
  (see the `truffle` component),
* implement a user interface for the resulting system
  (see the `snake` and `turtle` components),
* define a protocol and an architecture for distributing and extending it
  (see the `ape` and `flower` components and
  the associated `fur`, `scales`, `shell` and `spores` components) and
* accompany it with utility libraries
  (see the `ungulate`, `reptile` and `fungus` components).

The code in this repository is free software and, as such, licensed under

* the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

The development of this project

* started around 2018-05-01,
* continues as of 2021-08-01 and
* is expected to reach a usable state by 2022-05-01.

Currently, the authors of this project are

* Jukka Räbinä, who works on the `truffle` component at IQM Finland, and
* Sampsa Kiiskinen, who works on all the other components
  in the Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä.

Over the course of the project,

* Sampsa Kiiskinen has been partially funded by
    * the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation grant 170015 and
    * the University of Jyväskylä Graduate School and
* Jukka Räbinä has been partially funded by
    * the Academy of Finland grants 259925, 260076 and 295897 and
    * the European Research Council advanced grant 320773.
