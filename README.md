# Maniunfold

This is a code repository for a research project that aims to

* develop a type-theoretical model of discrete exterior calculus,
* formalize the model with the Coq proof assistant,
* extract OCaml code from the proof-relevant parts of the formalization,
* link the extracted code with existing numerical solvers and
* implement a user interface for the whole thing.

As one would expect,
the name of this project is a distasteful play on words,
relating the concepts of

* differentiable manifolds,
  the main objects of study in differential geometry, and
* anamorphisms,
  the familiar recursion schemes from purely functional programming.

Stay tuned for other equally useful facts about this project.
