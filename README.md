# Maniunfold

This is a repository for a research project that aims to

* develop a type-theoretical model of discrete exterior calculus,
* formalize the model with the Coq proof assistant,
* extract OCaml code from the proof-relevant parts of the formalization,
* link the extracted code with existing numerical solvers and
* implement a user interface for the whole thing.

The code in this repository is free software and, as such, licensed under

* the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

The development of this project

* started 2018-05-01,
* continues as of 2019-10-01 and
* is expected to reach a usable state by 2022-05-01.

Currently, the sole author of this project is

* Sampsa Kiiskinen, who works
  in the Faculty of Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä.

This project is partially funded by

* the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation (grant 170015).

As one would expect,
the name of this project is a distasteful play on words,
relating the concepts of

* differentiable manifolds,
  the main objects of study in differential geometry, and
* anamorphisms,
  the generalizations of common recursion schemes from functional programming.

Stay tuned for other equally useful facts about this project.
